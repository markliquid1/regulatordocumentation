# INA228 Battery Current/Voltage Monitor

## Overview

This circuit implements a battery monitoring system using the Texas Instruments INA228 current/voltage monitor IC. It measures both battery voltage and current through a low-side shunt resistor configuration, suitable for 48V battery systems with currents up to 500A (or any value, just need to keep shunt voltage <±163.84 mV)

## System Architecture

### Measurement Configuration
- **Battery Voltage Monitoring**: Direct measurement of battery positive terminal via VBUS input
- **Current Measurement**: Low-side shunt configuration with differential voltage measurement
- **Communication**: I2C interface at 7-bit address 0x40
- **Supply Voltage**: 3.3V logic supply

## Detailed Connection Descriptions

### Power and Signal Connections

#### Battery Interface
- **VBUS_INA228**: Connected directly to battery positive terminal
  - Feeds INA228 pin 8 (VBUS) for voltage measurement
  - Connected through R79 (100Ω) to system load
  - Low-pass filtered by R79 and C8 (1µF, 100V)

#### INA228 IC (U20) Pin Configuration
| Pin | Function | Connection |
|-----|----------|------------|
| 1   | GND      | System Ground |
| 2   | A0       | System Ground (I2C address = 0x40) |
| 3   | ALERT    | ALERT! signal output |
| 4   | SDA      | I2C_SDA |
| 5   | SCL      | I2C_SCL |
| 6   | VS       | 3.3V supply |
| 7   | GND      | System Ground |
| 8   | VBUS     | Battery positive measurement |
| 9   | IN-      | Shunt negative terminal |
| 10  | IN+      | Shunt positive terminal |

### Power Supply Decoupling
- **C8**: 1µF, 100V - VBUS supply decoupling
- **Power supply decoupling for 3.3V rail** (external to this circuit)

## Protection Circuitry

### ESD and Transient Protection

#### Differential Input Protection
- **D20, D21**: PESD5V0S1UL bidirectional ESD protection diodes
  - Connected between IN+ and IN- inputs
  - Protects against differential transients
  - 5V standoff voltage will have no affect on mV-level shunt signals

#### Overvoltage Protection
- **D15**: P6SMB68A transient voltage suppressor
  - Connected from VBUS to GND
  - **Standoff Voltage**: 58.1V (~suitable for 59V max battery voltage)
  - **Breakdown Voltage**: 64.6V minimum
  - **Clamping Voltage**: 92V maximum @ Ipp
  - Protects against battery overvoltage events

### Noise Filtering

#### RC Low-Pass Filters
All three measurement inputs feature identical RC low-pass filtering:

- **VBUS Filter**: R79 (100Ω) + C8 (1µF)
- **IN+ Filter**: R72 (100Ω) + C29 (1µF)  
- **IN- Filter**: R73 (100Ω) + C41 (1µF)

**Cutoff Frequency Calculation:**
```
fc = 1 / (2π × R × C)
fc = 1 / (2π × 100Ω × 1µF)
fc ≈ 1.59 kHz
```

All filters can be bypassed with Jumpers, though in some future iteration we may want to change where the jumpers are located to keep some level of protection.

#### Differential Noise Reduction
- **C25**: 100nF, 100V capacitor connected directly between IN+ and IN-
- Reduces common-mode noise on differential measurement
- Higher frequency filtering compared to individual RC filters
