# ESP32-S3 Reasoning

## Overview
The ESP32-S3 is well-suited for this application, offering the right balance of performance, I/O, and wireless capabilities.

## Key Strengths

- **USB Native Support**: Simplifies firmware upload and eliminates USB-serial converter requirements. Full-speed support with ESD protection and proper impedance control in the hardware 

- **Sufficient GPIO**: Easily accommodates ADS1115, INA228, opto-isolated UARTs, CAN transceiver, field driver PWM, and digital I/O without pin conflicts

- **Ample RAM & Flash**: 16MB flash and 8MB PSRAM handle OTA updates, filesystem (LittleFS), web server, and buffered sensor data without strain

- **WiFi Reliability**: Supports AP and client mode with watchdog, reconnection logic, and captive portal setup. Well-integrated into system behavior with GPIO override and exponential backoff handling

- **Low Power Sleep Modes**: When idle, power consumption drops to ~10 µA; critical for systems in standby or low-power configurations

- **Adequate Processing Power**: Dual-core Xtensa LX7 @ 240 MHz is sufficient for:
  - Real-time control loop (50–100 ms cadence)
  - NMEA 2000 CAN parsing
  - Field PWM generation
  - Sensor reading and web serving logic
