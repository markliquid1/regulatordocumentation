## Technology Platform Decision

**Selected Platform: Supabase + Vercel**
- **Backend**: Supabase for PostgreSQL database, auto-generated APIs, and authentication
- **Frontend**: Vercel for dashboard hosting and deployment
- **Security**: True isolation - OTA server separate from dashboard infrastructure
- **AI-friendly development** with extensive code generation capabilities for both platforms
- Predictable costs starting free, scaling to ~$25-45/month for 500 users

### Platform Comparison & Selection Rationale

**Firebase (Rejected):**
- NoSQL database cannot handle complex leaderboard queries (no JOINs, limited sorting)
- Simple queries like "fastest 35ft sailboat" require complex workarounds
- Real-time features good but terrible for analytics
- Unpredictable costs with potential spikes

**Traditional VPS + PostgreSQL (Considered):**
- Perfect for relational data and complex queries
- Full control and predictable costs ($30/month)
- More setup work and server management required
- Less AI development assistance available

**Supabase + Vercel (Selected):**
- **Best of both worlds**: PostgreSQL + modern real-time features + global hosting
- **Security isolation**: Dashboard completely separate from OTA server
- **Auto-generated APIs** reduce backend coding
- **Extensive AI training data** for code generation on both platforms
- **Built-in authentication and security**
- **Zero server management** for dashboard
- Can evolve from simple analytics to social platform

### Hosting Architecture & Security

**Infrastructure Separation:**
- `ota.xengineering.net` ‚Üí Existing VPS (firmware updates only, unchanged)
- `dashboard.xengineering.net` ‚Üí Vercel hosting (dashboard frontend)
- `yourproject.supabase.co` ‚Üí Supabase managed backend (data & APIs)

**Security Benefits:**
- **True isolation**: OTA server compromise cannot affect dashboard
- **Minimal attack surface**: OTA server stays exactly as-is
- **Managed security**: Supabase and Vercel handle security patches
- **Separate credentials**: No shared access between systems

### AI Development Workflow Advantages
- **ChatGPT can generate complete Supabase + Vercel projects**
- **Vercel has massive AI training data** due to popularity
- Standard PostgreSQL queries are well-known to AI
- React dashboard components easily generated
- Authentication flows follow standard patterns
- **Minimal learning curve** for non-web developers
- **4-hour planning doc speed** maintained through development

## 5. Data Architecture & Payload Structure

### JSON Payload Organization
- **Nested JSON objects** for related data grouping
- **Integer storage strategy** for decimal values to avoid floating point errors
- **Consistent scaling factors**: voltage √ó 100, current √ó 10, GPS √ó 100000

### Example 6-Hour Payload Structure
```
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T12:00:00Z",
  "device_id": "esp32_aabbccddee",
  "energy": {
    "solar_kwh": 25,          // 2.5 kWh √ó 10
    "alternator_kwh": 18,     // 1.8 kWh √ó 10  
    "consumed_kwh": 31        // 3.1 kWh √ó 10
  },
  "battery": {
    "soc_min": 65, "soc_max": 89, "soc_avg": 78,
    "voltage_min": 1280,      // 12.80V √ó 100
    "voltage_max": 1420,      // 14.20V √ó 100
    "charge_cycles": 2
  },
  "alternator": {
    "runtime_minutes": 67,
    "max_amps": 850,          // 85.0A √ó 10
    "avg_amps": 420           // 42.0A √ó 10
  },
  "navigation": {
    "distance_miles": 125,    // 12.5 miles √ó 10

    "start_lng": -7025700     // -70.257¬∞ √ó 100000
  }
}
```

### Polar Data Collection Strategy
- **Collection frequency**: Every 10 minutes while sailing
- **Data volume impact**: 6x more frequent than other metrics (36 points per 6-hour upload)
- **Storage strategy**: Include in main 6-hour payload for simplicity
- **Future optimization**: May require separate daily upload if payload becomes too large

## 6. Final Decisions Made ‚úÖ

### Data Sharing & Privacy
- **All data is shared** - requirement for having the product
- **GPS precision reduced** - remove last digits for privacy
- **Pseudonym usernames** - boat names encouraged
- **Global leaderboards** - no regional divisions
- **All features free** - no monetization strategy needed at this time

### Data Architecture
- **Data format**: JSON for easiest expansion later
- **GPS breadcrumb frequency**: 1 point per hour (6 points per 6-hour upload batch. Need to make sure we have sufficient local space for 180 days)
- **Sailing vs motoring detection**: Engine on/off status determined ESP32-side (splits certain data categories such as max speed becomes "max speed motoring" and "max speed sailing")
- **Local storage strategy**: Use full userdata partition (3.9MB/0x3D0000 bytes) until cloud upload or 180 days is reached. After 180 days, I will try to overwrite oldest data first.
- **Offline storage capacity is a non issue**: ~487 days at 4 uploads/day (~2KB per payload)

### Upload Strategy
- **6-hour upload frequency** - major architectural decision
- **Max/min/average aggregation** - not raw data streams
- **500 user target** - stay in free tier initially
- **Server-side validation** - sanity checks before public data
- **Retry logic**: Don't even try uploading if internet is not detected. Exponential backoff (every 1 min for 1 hr. if failed, then 1x per 2 hours for 6 hours, then wait 24 hours)
- **Only upload new data**
- **Keep 180 days of data locally anyway, no reason not to, unless it's significantly easier to manage if we keep deleting it after confirmed successful upload**

### Authentication & User Management
- **Device-tied authentication**: One-time pairing during initial setup
- **Auto-login from ESP32 app**: Embedded auth tokens provide invisible access
- **External access**: Standard username/password from any device/location
- **Multi-device support**: Simultaneous access from ESP32 + phone + laptop
- **No re-authentication required**: Persistent sessions with optional refresh

### Hosting & Infrastructure Strategy
- **OTA server isolation**: Keep `ota.xengineering.net` completely separate and unchanged
- **Dashboard hosting**: `dashboard.xengineering.net` on Vercel for global performance
- **Backend services**: Supabase for database, APIs, and authentication
- **Security architecture**: True separation prevents cross-system compromise
- **AI development priority**: Chose Vercel for superior AI assistance and documentation

### Server-Side Processing Requirements
- **Route-based leaderboards**: MUST be server-side (geo-fence start/finish line detection)
- **Sailing polar diagrams**: Server-side aggregation of historical data
- **Complex calculations**: "Farthest from home", "Most remote location", "Days at sea"
- **Fleet statistics aggregation**

### Cost & Scaling
- **Target users**: 500 users maximum for initial scale
- **GPS storage cost**: ~$0.18/month for GPS data (1GB over 5 years)
- **Hosting costs**: $0-45/month total (Supabase + Vercel)

### Admin & Moderation
- **Data validation**: Implement framework to discard data beyond hardcoded physical limits
- **Outlier handling**: Delete bad data entirely. IE bad data becomes NAN or just not there
- **Admin privileges**: Required for editing leaderboards and user management

### Email & Messaging (Future)
- **Monthly emails**: Triggered 1st of month, requires unsubscribe mechanism
- **Future messaging**: Can be added later without schema changes. Plan userID structure robustly now.
- **Messaging architecture**: Will require server-mediated (not direct device-to-device due to NAT)

### Technical Implementation Decisions
- **Sailing polar data frequency**: Every 10 minutes while sailing
- **Multi-user support**: ONE USER PER DEVICE
- **MVP complexity reduction**: Drop "Fastest-Over-Route" and "Sailing Polar Plots" from initial release
- **Admin dashboard**: Need separate admin interface for moderation and system management
- **Data retention**: NO AGGREGATION NECESSARY, WE ALREADY SHOWED THAT, ON EITHER ESP32 OR SERVER SIDE. DATA SIZE IS TINY.
